							Like many things it started with a simple idea. An idea to reinvent the way we read the news. Today’s generation isn’t about being knowledgeable in a single topic, but rather well informed in a broad range of topics.  We took that very concept and built an application that allows readers to stay informed about the topics important to the world. As a team, we felt that the readers opinion  amongst most news sources was completely undermined. Our application gives users a new and exciting way to interpret the news by viewing the reactions of a story first, rather than the article itself. We hope to you enjoy using NewsPulse as much as we enjoyed creating it for you.
